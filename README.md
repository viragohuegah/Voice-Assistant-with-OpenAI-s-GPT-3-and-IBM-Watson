<br>Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completion of Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson from [CognitiveClass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/chatapp-powered-by-openai)

We will build an AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, this personal assistant 
will use voice. We will use Watson Speech-to-Text to give this AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that the assistant can read the answers back to you.
